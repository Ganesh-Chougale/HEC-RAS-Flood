**HEC-RAS** (Hydrologic Engineering Centerâ€™s *River Analysis System*) is a free software developed by the **US Army Corps of Engineers** for:

ðŸ”¹ **Modeling water flow** in rivers and channels
ðŸ”¹ **Simulating floods, water surface profiles, and sediment transport**
ðŸ”¹ Analyzing **steady/unsteady flow**, **2D flow**, and **dam breaks**

Used mainly by **civil engineers, hydrologists**, and **urban planners** for floodplain mapping, bridge design, and river management.
