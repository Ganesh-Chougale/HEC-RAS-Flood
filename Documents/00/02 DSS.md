A **DSS file** stands for **Data Storage System file**, mainly used by **HEC software** (like HEC-RAS, HEC-HMS). Itâ€™s a special file format developed by the **US Army Corps of Engineers** for storing large sets of time-series or gridded data.

### ðŸ”¹ What it stores:

* River flow data
* Rainfall records
* Water levels
* Simulation results

### ðŸ”¹ Why it's used:

* Super fast reading/writing of large hydrology datasets
* Organizes data using a 6-part pathname (like folders for time, location, parameter, etc.)

You donâ€™t open a DSS file like Excelâ€”HEC tools or **HEC-DSSVue** (a viewer) are used to view/edit them.
